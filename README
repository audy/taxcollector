  I.  DESCRIPTION
  
    These scripts can be used to derive full taxonomic descriptions from the FASTA files of
    the Ribosomal Database Project () and GreenGenes () 16s rRNA sequence databases.
  
    Elaboration of the taxonomy allows for the files to be used later on in MegaBlast.
  
    This script was originally part of the Pangea Project (www.microgator.org)
  
  
  II. WHAT'S INCLUDED
  
    Green.py    -   Taxonomic Elaborator for the GreenGenes database.
    RDP.py      -   Taxonomic Elaborator for the RDP database.
    acctotax.py -   Generates a flat text file of ProkMSA numbers and their corresponding
                    NCBI TaxIDs for use by Green.py
    
  III. INSTRUCTIONS
  
    First download the taxdump file from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/)
    and extract it.  You will need the Names.dmp and Nodes.dmp files.  It is a good
    idea to update these as often as you update the RDP/GreenGenes databases.
  
      a. RDP:
        
          Download the RDP FASTA file from the Ribosomal Database Project.
        
          The script can be invoked thusly,
        
          > python rdp.py names.dmp nodes.dmp input_fasta_file.fas output_fasta_file.fas
          
      b. GreenGenes:
      
          The GreenGenes database requires an extra step.  You must generate a table
          of corresponding ProkMSA ID's and TaxIDs.  To do this, download the Green-
          Genes database in "GreenGenes" format (usually a .txt file).  Then run the
          script acctotax to generate the table:
          
          > python acctotax.py inputfile
          
          The script automatically generates an output file named 'inputfileout'
          
          Now you can run the TaxCollector script, green.py which is invoked as thus,
          
          > python green.py names.dmp nodes.dmp proktable.txt input.fas output.fas
          
  IV. OUTPUT FORMAT
  
    These scripts output headers in the following format:
    
    >[7]Domain[6]Phylum[5]Class[4]Order[3]Family[2]Genus[1]Species
    
    Weird NCBI taxonomies are not included, such as "subphylum"
    You can alter this by editing the global list TaxExemption
    Note that order and case matter.
    
    If there is a gap between levels of taxonomy in the NCBI names database, Tax-
    Collector will repeat the lower level in quotes, example:
    
    >[7]Domain[6]Phylum[5]"Order"[4]Order[3]Family[2]Genus[1]Species
    
  V. TODO:
  
  1.) Combine greeen.py and rdp.py into just taxcollector.py
  2.) Find a better way of creating names for GreenGenes (i.e. one that doesn't involve downloading
  another huge database just for some IDs).
  3.) Refactor code, make it more modular.  Allow for piping with other scripts.
  4.) Make into an iPhone game.
